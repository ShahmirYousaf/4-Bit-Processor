# 4-Bit Processor

Welcome to the 4-Bit Processor project! In this project, I undertook a fascinating endeavor in Digital Logic Design during my second semester. I successfully designed a 4-bit processor capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations. This processor incorporated essential components such as registers, decoders, multiplexers, logic gates, and display units, among others. By utilizing these components effectively, I created a functional and efficient processor capable of executing various operations.

## Overview

The 4-Bit Processor project aimed to explore the fundamentals of digital logic design by implementing a basic processor architecture. The project involved designing and integrating key components to create a fully functional processor capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations on 4-bit binary data.

## Key Components

- **Registers**: Used for storing data temporarily during processing.
- **Decoders**: Used for decoding control signals and directing them to the appropriate components.
- **Multiplexers**: Used for selecting inputs based on control signals.
- **Logic Gates**: Used for performing logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.
- **Display Units**: Used for visualizing the output of the processor.

## Functionalities

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of 4-bit binary numbers.
- **Logical Operations**: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations on 4-bit binary data.
- **Display Output**: Visualization of the result of operations on display units.

## Implementation

The 4-Bit Processor project was implemented using digital logic design principles and tools such as logic gates, multiplexers, and flip-flops. The design process involved conceptualizing the processor architecture, designing individual components, and integrating them to create the final processor.
